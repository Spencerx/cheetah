Cheetah
=======

Cheetah is a simple library for executing external commands safely and conveniently. It is meant as a safe replacement of <code>\`backticks\`</code>, `Kernel#system` and similar methods, which are often used in unsecure way (they allow shell expansion of commands).

Proper documentation is coming soon.
